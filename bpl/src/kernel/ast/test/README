README file for kernel/ast/test
======================================

This directory contains:

bdnfTest.sml:  SML code for running tests on .bgtest

bplTest.sml: SML code for running tests on .bpltest

*-*.bgtest: Sample bigraph input for testing

*.bpltest: Sample bigraph input for testing

The bgtest sample files are numbered lexicographically,
MAJOR-MINOR[-MINOR2].bgtest, with the intention that it tests the
MINOR2 aspect of MINOR aspect of feature number MAJOR. The bpltest
files are merely named after their "main test subject".

There is no strict way of determining what counts as MAJOR or MINOR
aspects; look at the examples and use your own Common Sense(tm). The
main point is to allow numbering to be multidimensionally extendable
so that new test cases can be added to already tested MAJOR or MINOR
features in a systematic way.


TESTING
=======

Testing is probably best done from the top directory. bdnfTest.sml is
intended to be run by the SMLUnit framework (see the SML# project at
http://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/ ), but one can probably
hack up an adequate similar framework relatively quickly. 

Testing with .bpltest files can be done by cd'ing to the dir $SRC and
executing './bplparser kernel/ast/test/<filename>'.

IF YOU FIND A BUG...
====================

...then please add a minimal test case that detects the bug!
