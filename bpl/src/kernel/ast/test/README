README file for kernel/ast/test
======================================

This directory contains:

bdnfTest.sml:  SML code for running tests

*-*.bg: Sample bigraph input for testing



The sample files are numbered lexicographically, MAJOR-MINOR[-MINOR2].bg,
with the intention that it tests the MINOR2 aspect of MINOR aspect
of feature number MAJOR.

There is no strict way of determining what counts as MAJOR or
MINOR aspects; look at the examples and use your own Common Sense(tm).
The main point is to allow numbering to be multidimensionally
extendable so that new test cases can be added to already tested
MAJOR or MINOR features in a systematic way.


TESTING
=======

Testing is probably best done from the top directory.  bdnfTest.sml is
intended to be run by the SMLUnit framework (see the SML# project
at http://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/ ), but one can 
probably hack up an adequate similar framework relatively quickly.


IF YOU FIND A BUG...
====================

..then add a minimal test case that detects the bug!
