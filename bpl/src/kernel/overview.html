The main module is BPL; it binds together all the other modules.
Utility libraries are documented in the
<a href="../lib/" target="_top">libraries API doc</a>.
</p>

<p>
The BGTERM, BGVAL or BGBDNF modules implement abstract data types for bigraph
terms (i.e., terms that might not be well-formed), bigraph
values (i.e., well-formed terms not necessarily in BDNF),
and BDNF bigraphs.
</p>

<p>
Refer to these modules for detailed information on how to
(de)construct and prettyprint such objects.  In general, for
construction you must supply the underlying
wiring / permutation / ion / ... which can be produced by the corresponding
module.
</p>

<p>
For instance, a BDNF wiring can be produced thus:
<pre>
structure NameSet = OrderSet (Name.Order)
structure LinkSet = OrderSet (Link.Order)
structure BgVal = BgVal (type info = int * int
                         ...)
structure BgBDNF = BgBDNF (...)
structure BDNFErrorHandler = BDNFErrorHandler (...)
let
  val [x, y, z] = map Name.make ["x", "y", "z"]
  val ls = [{outer = SOME x, inner = NameSet.fromList [y, z]},
            {outer = NONE, inner = NameSet.fromList [y, x]},
	    {outer = SOME y, inner = NameSet.empty}]
  val lset = LinkSet.fromList ls
  val w = Wiring.make lset
in
  BgBDNF.make (BgVal.Wir (0,0) w)
end
  handle error => (BDNFErrorHandler.explain error; raise error);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For entering bigraph values directly in ML syntax, refer to the SUGAR
module.
