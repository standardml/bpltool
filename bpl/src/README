DOCUMENTATION LOCATIONS
=======================

For information on how to install BPL, see the file named INSTALL.

For information on directory structure, see the file named DIRTREE,
which is autogenerated by running `make DIRTREE'.

Browseable module API documentation can be generated from the source
files using the SMLDoc tool available from the SML# Project at
http://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/?SMLDoc 

For theoretical and background information on BPL, see
http://www.itu.dk/research/theory/bpl/

For theoretical information on implementation of normalisation, see
doc/bplimpl/bplimpl.tex in the BPL CVS repository.

For version information, see the file named VERSION.

For licencing information, see the file named COPYING.


DOWNLOAD
========

The BPL SML package is available from
http://www.itu.dk/research/theory/bpl/


TESTING
=======

Unit testing can be done in the SMLDoc framework, available from the
SML# Project at http://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/?SMLUnit ,
by running SML/NJ and issuing these commands:
  CM.make' "sources-smlnj-test.cm";
  SMLNJTest.run ();

Testing without SMLUnit is probably possible, but requires a little
hacking.


REPORTING BUGS
