  14/10/2005: Created
   8/11/2005: Slight revision
  17/11/2005: Introduced state and interface to S (s.bpl) and A (a.sml)
  25/11/2005: Minor code changes and expanded interface to S
  16/05/2006: Removed mutual recursion - need to interface with miniml
	      tool, bplgen etc.
  18/05/2006: Rewrote some functions to take only one parameter,
	      explicit string equality,
              rewrote local statement to use 'let val' instead.
  25/07/2006: Introduced 'dev' as data type,
              rewrote functions to take one one parameter,
	      rewrote some functions to return option type,
              embedded 'model = ref(...)' in 'val funs = ...',
	      exported 'funs',
              changed building example,
              changed tests.
  26/07/2006: Introduced parent map (is that cheating?),
	      range query,
	      'lid' as data type,
	      navigation query.
  02/08/2006: Removed 'map',
	      corrected a comment.
  27/10/2006: Introduced 'event' as data type,
	      introduced event loop,
	      introduced a queue with enqueue and dequeue functions,
	      redefined 'sobs', 'slost', and 'state'.
	      COMMENT: Do we also need to export aux. function names?
  30/10/2006: Replaced ~1 with options.
  02/02/2007: Introduced spinlock on queue.
  05/02/2007: Introduced WhereIs event,
              removed some dead code.
  09/02/2007: Changed sobs and slost to not introduce new devices,
	      introduced allDevs variable,
	      changed type of 'inactive' from dev list to hierarchy,
	      ported functions to use new state and export format,
	      tested interfaces to S and A.
 
  This is the "location model" part L of a Plato-graphical system;
  C || P || A = C || (S || L) || A.

  The code is kept as simple (not optimised for performance) as possible
  because the bigraphical image tends to explode sizewise reverting the
  effect of complicated optimisations.
